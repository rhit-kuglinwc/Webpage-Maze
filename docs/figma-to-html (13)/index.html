Have you seen this character? I do not know how or why, but this small, poorly draw, flat character has been ending my descents into this maze. I will be thousands of pages into this when it abruptly ends and he is there, seemingly waiting for me with his smug, knowing smile. It drives me insane.</span><span class="v84_2177">This probably does not matter. After all, this is just a silly little maze game, not too much depth needed. Actually, I realize now this tirade was unnecessary. I apologize for taking your time. Here, a button to return to the beginning of this mess.</span><div class="v84_2180"></div><div class="name"></div></div></body></html>
