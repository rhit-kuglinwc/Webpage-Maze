    <p class="intro">Welcome to The Webpage Maze
        Take a path to try and reach the end of this awful, amazing, creative, boring, colourful, abysmal,
        repetitive, straight-forward, etc. maze.</p>
    <p>Paths are how you traverse this maze. These paths can be found in all shapes and sizes. As buttons with
        text, as URLs or similar links, or as an image!
        Almost anything and everything should be suspected of being a path! These paths
        can even be hidden! In this maze, you will go through several different pages to try and
        find an end of the maze. The pages you pass by could be any type of mock up. Fake digital stores, band
        websites, etc.</p>
