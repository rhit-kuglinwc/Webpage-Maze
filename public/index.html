        <p class="intro">Welcome to The Webpage Maze! Take a path to try and reach the end of this awful, amazing,
            creative, boring, colourful, abysmal, repetitive, straight-forward, twisty-turny maze. Paths are how you
            traverse this maze. These paths can be found in all shapes and sizes. Almost anything and everything should
            be suspected of being a path! These paths can even be hidden! In this maze, you will go through several
            different pages to try and find an end of the maze. The pages you pass by could be any type of mock up. Fake
            digital stores, band websites, etc. Basically, click things to find an end, then do it again for more fun.
